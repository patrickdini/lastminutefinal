### Recent Changes (August 2025)
- **Perks System Integration**: Added comprehensive perks system using LMActivities and LMPerkRules tables to display complimentary activities next to night counts in booking options
- **Face Value Calculation**: Implemented total value calculation showing room cost (rate Ã— nights) + perks face_price values, with per-person activity pricing support
- **Enhanced Pricing Display**: Shows both "Face Value" (crossed out) and "Your Price" to highlight guest savings and value proposition
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced auto-refresh from 30 seconds to 5 minutes to improve user experience and reduce server load
- **Per-Person Activity Logic**: Smart detection of per-person vs fixed-price activities based on LMActivities comments field parsing
- **Database Integration**: Rule-based perks attribution using villa_id, nights, adults, children parameters for personalized perk offerings
- **Date Filtering Fix (Aug 14, 2025)**: Resolved critical date filtering reliability issues by eliminating double filtering logic, implementing single-point filtering in generateOffersFromData(), and correctly defining weekend as Friday-Sunday (Fri-Sun) rather than Saturday-Sunday for proper "This Weekend" filter behavior
- **Villa Configuration Manager (Aug 14, 2025)**: Implemented full-screen admin interface for villa configuration management, replacing modal approach. Added dedicated /admin/villa-config page with comprehensive villa settings, capacity limits, amenities, and guest limit controls.
- **Database Consolidation (Aug 14, 2025)**: Consolidated villa configuration architecture by merging LMvilla_config data into LMRoomDescription table and creating LMGeneralConfig for global settings. Added migration endpoint /admin/api/migrate-villa-tables to seamlessly transfer configuration data. This improves performance by reducing table joins and provides centralized configuration management.
- **Complete Villa Field Management (Aug 14, 2025)**: Enhanced villa configuration interface to display and manage all 22 fields from LMRoomDescription table including villa name, class, type, square meters, webpage URL, bedrooms, bathrooms, max guests/adults, tagline, description, image URLs, video tour URL, ideal for, featured status, view type, pool type, key amenities, and active status. Full CRUD operations now supported with proper database field mapping and validation.
- **Simplified Authentication System (Aug 14, 2025)**: Changed admin authentication from bcrypt password hashing to plain text passwords stored in LMadmin_users table. This allows easy password management directly through phpMyAdmin interface. Admin credentials: username "patrick" with password "VillaTokay2025!" stored as plain text in the database password field.
- **Enhanced Load More Functionality (Aug 15, 2025)**: Implemented comprehensive pagination system supporting unlimited "Load More" actions. Backend now supports pagination across all unique villa/date combinations (not just unique villas), ensuring users can browse through all available champion offers. Frontend prevents page jumps by preserving scroll position, shows loading states, and smoothly appends new villa cards below existing content. System maintains champion selection algorithm while supporting deep pagination through all available offers.
