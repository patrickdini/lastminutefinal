Of course. Here is a clear, step-by-step guide for your developer on how to centralize the website's stylesheets.

### **Subject: Action Required: Centralizing Our CSS for Better Consistency**

Hi [Developer Name],

To improve the visual consistency and maintainability of the Villa Tokay website, we're going to consolidate our scattered CSS files into a centralized stylesheet. This will ensure a cohesive look and feel across all pages and make future updates much more efficient.

Here’s the plan:

### **Step 1: Create a Master Stylesheet**

First, create a new file named `main.css` in the `/public` directory. This file will contain all the common styles that are shared across the entire website.

### **Step 2: Consolidate Common Styles**

Next, identify and move all the common styles from the existing CSS files into `main.css`. This includes styles for:

  * **Typography**: Headings, paragraphs, links, etc.
  * **Color Palette**: Use CSS variables for brand colors.
  * **Buttons**: All button styles (primary, secondary, etc.).
  * **Forms**: Input fields, labels, text areas, etc.
  * **Layout**: Common layout styles like containers and grids.

The files to review for consolidation are:

  * `public/styles.css`
  * `public/confirm-booking.css`
  * `public/admin/admin-styles.css`

### **Step 3: Refactor HTML Files**

After consolidating the common styles, update all HTML files to link to the new `main.css` stylesheet and remove the links to the old stylesheets.

For example, in `public/index.html`, the `<head>` section should be updated to:

```html
<head>
    ...
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/main.css?v=__ASSET_VERSION__" />
    ...
</head>
```

### **Step 4: Create Component-Specific Stylesheets**

For styles that are unique to a specific page or section (like the admin dashboard), keep them in a separate, component-specific stylesheet. This will keep `main.css` clean and focused on global styles.

For example, you can create a file named `admin-specific.css` for styles that are only used in the admin section.

### **Step 5: Load Stylesheets in the Correct Order**

Finally, make sure to load the stylesheets in the correct order in your HTML files. The master stylesheet (`main.css`) should be loaded first, followed by any component-specific stylesheets. This will ensure that specific styles can override the general ones when needed.

Here’s an example of how the `<head>` section of an admin page should look:

```html
<head>
    ...
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/main.css?v=__ASSET_VERSION__" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/admin/admin-specific.css?v=__ASSET_VERSION__" />
    ...
</head>
```

By following these steps, we can create a more consistent and maintainable codebase for the Villa Tokay website.
